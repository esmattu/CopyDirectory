# CopyDirectory

This small WinForms app is a test to see how I can create a class that process an action (copy the files from one directory to a selected folder). 
The action of this class will be seperate from the code UI. I have also implemented a method to prevent the UI from getting blocked and call the class
to copy the files in a background thread; this will allow the UI to act as normal.
